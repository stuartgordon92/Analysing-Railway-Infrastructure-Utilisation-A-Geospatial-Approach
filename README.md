# Analysing Railway Infrastructure Utilisation: A Geospatial Approach
Repositiory for MRes Thesis - Analysing Railway Infrastructure Utilisation: A Geospatial Approach

## Project Summary
In the evolving landscape of transportation, the optimisation of railway infrastructure utilisation emerges as a pivotal concern and a significant opportunity to enhance public transport. This project dives into the intricacies of railway infrastructure utilisation, focusing on the challenges of determining train service paths using both traditional methods and innovative predictive models. The study reviews methods from current literature for deducing network utilisation and capacity, with a particular emphasis on validating these findings against empirical data and use of real-world examples. Adopting a geospatial approach, the research calculates train paths to determine infrastructure utilisation and conducts a comparative analysis between the actual and planned utilisation of the train service. The results revealed a range of outputs, with discrepancies primarily due to data quality challenges. The unexpected inclusion of industrial action during the data collection period showcased the system's adaptability and provided a unique operational perspective. The comparisons between a typical and degraded service in different geographical areas underscored the methodology's potential even with data limitations. Incidents were not able to be detected though the comparison between planned and actual utilisation methodology with current data limitations however use of the probabilistic model in an alternative use could achieve this. To accommodate the expansive UK network, technologies such as NoSQL databases and serverless cloud native concepts, were employed to amplify scalability. While the project achieved most of its goals, it underscores the continual need for validation given the vast and dynamic nature of the system and its sensitivity to data quality and availability when monitoring large dynamic real world systems.
